# Contributing to esm.sh

Welcome, and thank you for taking time in contributing to esm.sh project!

## Development setup

You will need [Golang](https://golang.org/) 1.18+.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local device.
3. Create a new branch `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`.
4. Change code then run the testings.
5. Push your branch to Github after **all tests passed**.
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/pulls).
7. Merge to master branch by our maintainers.

## Configration

To configure the server, create a `config.json` file in the project root directory. Here is an example:

```jsonc
// config.json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "workDir": ".esmd",
  "npmRegistry": "https://registry.npmjs.org",
  "npmToken": "xxxxxx"
}
```

You can find all the server options in [config.exmaple.jsonc](./config.example.jsonc).

## Run the sever in development mode

```bash
go run main.go --dev
```

Then you can import `React` from "http://localhost:8080/react"

## Run testings

```bash
# Run all tests
./test/bootstrap.sh

# Run tests for a specific case (directory name)
./test/bootstrap.sh preact

# Run tests with `clean` option (purge previous builds)
./test/bootstrap.sh --clean
```

All the tests are written in [Deno](https://deno.land), you can find them in [test/](./test) directory.
